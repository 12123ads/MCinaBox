## Background

`Origin` I discovered the BoardwalkApp a few years ago, which can launch Minecraft Java Edition on Android devices. It's so exciting to see minecraft start on my phone. Thanks to Boardwalk, it left a deep impression on me, and since then I have also developed interest and love in programming. I learned Java programming for 8 days through 'Head First Java', and started to write my first Android program MCinaBox with the support of BoatApp Project.<br>
